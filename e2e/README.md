# end-to-end testing with Detox

## Environment Setup

It is reccomended these tests be run from a terminal prompt with unlimited lines of scroll-back.

Instructions for iTerm2: open Preferences -> open "Profiles" tab -> *your profile* -> "Terminal" sub top-bar tab -> check âœ“ "Unlimited Scrollback"

## iOS setup

1. Follow main repo install instructions
2. then, from a shell open in the repo run:

   `brew tap wix/brew && brew install applesimutils`
3. be sure the project builds in Xcode

## Android setup

1. Get yourself one or more emulators, you have options:

- [Detox recommends Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) emulators](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.AndroidDevEnv.md#android-aosp-emulators)
- Install from Android Studio with [these instructions](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.AndroidDevEnv.md#installing-from-android-studio)

2. (Optional) [Set up quick boot](https://github.com/wix/Detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.AndroidDevEnv.md#emulator-quick-boot) on the emulator.

**NOTE**: The AOSP emulators appear to require Java 8 (JDK 1.8). You may have a newer version of Java, like Java 15 installed...

**IMPORTANT JAVA NOTICE**

## Tests

### Configuration

*outilned in `.detoxrc.json`*

### Onboarding

A shared test that gets through onboarding. Used before other tests to get deeper into the app.

### ExploreDemoMenu

Staging app build only: iterates through every page of the app using the debug menu, taking screenshots as it goes. Find the output in `artifacts` folder.

## Running Tests

### Preparation

The following commands will run a Detox build. This need to be re-run whenever logic changes are made to the app.

`yarn pre:test:android`

or

`yarn pre:test:ios`

### Metro server

*Metro server must be running* for Detox to interact with the app. You might not have a metro server running if you haven't recently run `yarn pre:test:ios`, or if you've run it, but closed the many prompts it opens.

From a separate terminal tab, or prompt, navigate to the app repo and run `yarn start` (an alias for `npx react-native start`)

![Now you're ready to run Detox](SetupToRunDetox.png)

**BUNDLE BUILDING TAKES TIME**
-> see progress bar indicator at bottom of Metro server window.

### Individual tests

From a command prompt at the main repo directory, executing, for example:

`detox test e2e/exploreDemoMenu.e2e.js --configuration=ios`

will load the simulator and run that particular test

or use `--configuration=android.aosp` to test using the android AOSP simulator.

A succesful run of this test will look like follows:

![Succesful Detox run of exploreDemoMenu.e2e.js](SuccesfulDemoMenuTest.png)
This test ran in 100 seconds on a 2017, 13-inch Macbook Pro laptop.

### Running the entire test suite

This may take several minutes, and heavily uses computer resources while running.

Executing either

 `yarn test:android`

or

`yarn test:ios`

from the root fo the project will execute all `.e2e.js` tests containted in the `/e2e` folder. They are all run in parallel by Jest, and thus order of execution is not guaranteed.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Sorted by "deeper into the rabbit hole":

### Simulator Errors/Warnings

You may dismiss warnings, and they should go away for the lifetime of the simulator. However...

> Important:
If Errors pop up they will **overlap the visual items** the simulator is trying to show, and thus **block the items below them**.  If your issues persist, please file an [Issue on Github](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/issues) to see if the error(s) can be remedied or handled differently.

This is a common fault, for example, at Onboarding from background checks failing to preoperly execute in the simulator...

### (iOS) Detox builds fail unexpectedly

Many things can cause builds to fail. Basically, the app must succesfully build in Xcode, deploy to and open the simulator in Xcode (or with `yarn run-ios`), otherwise Detox builds won't work... but here are some things to try:

1. Open the app project in Xcode
2. (optional) NavBar -> Product -> Clean Build Folder (accept to kill any running instances)
3. navigate throught Left Sidebar -> Folder Icon -> click on "CovidShield" project -> opens -> middle top tab "Signing & Capabilities" -> middle lower top tab "Debug" -> collapsible section "Signing" -> dropdown "Provisionning Profile" -> make sure no errors here...
4. Top bar -> ensure Active Scheme set to "Staging"
5. Top bar -> ensure Target Device set to preferred simulator (iPhone 8 reccomended)

### (iOS) Detox builds fail with specific message

```node
> xcodebuild: error: The workspace named "CovidShield" does not contain a scheme named "SchemeName".
```

The Xcode build schema was changed and needs to be updated in `.detoxrc.json`.

### (Android) Detox builds fail unexpectedly

1. Open the app project in Android Studio
2. You likely have updates pending, apply them all.
3. Top bar -> Build project

Project must succesfully build in Android Studio, otherwise it'll never work on the command-line...

### Tests Failing

#### Randomly

just run the test once more... this is pretty common.

#### with Specific Messages

```node
> Test Failed: No views in hierarchy found matching: (with tag value: is "someTagName"
```

this means one test item is looking for an HTML-like item with a tag/attribute of the name "someTagName", and is not finding it. Most likely a swipe/scroll handle not set (by the devs) in a newly made "SomethingView.tsx".

### (Android) In the case of

```bash
> Task :@react-native-community_async-storage:processDebugAndroidTestResources FAILED
```

you can try: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
